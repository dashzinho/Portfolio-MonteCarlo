This project uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate financial risk metrics for a portfolio of stocks. It calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) to help understand potential financial losses under different scenarios.

Features
Data Collection: Downloads historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
Simulation: Runs 10,000 simulations to forecast potential future portfolio values.
Metrics: Calculates Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) to assess financial risk.
Visualization: Plots the distribution of final portfolio values and highlights VaR and ES.
